                                <p> Hi, I'm Kennen! I graduated from UC
                                Riverside with a BS in computer science. I'm
                                most interested in the fields of artificial
                                intelligence and computer security, and how they
                                may be used together. However, I truly love everything about computer science, and am
                                always trying to further myself. I'm definitely
                                a lifelong learner. </p>
                                <p> Currently, I'm taking this summer to relax
                                and travel, since I just finished my degree. I
                                will be working at Amazon in Santa Monica as a Software
                                Development Engineer starting in October!</p>

                                <p> My team and I built this <a
                                href="https://github.com/willshiao/fake-block"
                                target="_blank">project</a> during
                                Citrus Hack 2019, and it won 1st Place Overall,
                                Best Entrepreneurial Hack, and Best Use of
                                Google Cloud Platform. We utilized a mob
                                programming methodology, so I worked on and
                                gained experience with all portions of the
                                project. I learned how to create a functioning
                                Chrome extension with a python flask server on
                                Google Compute Engine that used Google Memory
                                Store caching and ran our machine learning
                                classifier. Overall, I was able to apply
                                knowledge from machine learning, web
                                development, natural language processing, and
                                cloud computing.</p>
                                <h5 class="major">Amazon: 06/2018 - 09/2018</h5>
                                <p>I worked as a Software
                                Development Engineer Intern on the Amazon
                                Studios / Prime Video mixed reality team. I used
                                internal technologies, as well as C# and Unity.
                                I improved my skills with version control (Git),
                                and applied agile methodologies. I successfully
                                built my project and integrated it into my
                                team's product. Currently, this product is
                                confidential, but I will add more details when
                                this is no longer the case!</p>

                                <p> I also work as a Supplemental Instruction
                                Leader for computer science at UC Riverside.
                                This job entails teaching an extra, ungraded
                                class for historically difficult, lower division
                                computer science courses. I also supervise
                                fellow SI Leaders as a mentor, and help them be
                                the best teachers to their students.</p>

                                Riverside. I started off on FPGA research, which led to me
                                co-authoring <a

                                The research topic focused on the speedup and

                                CPU. I wrote python scripts to run CPU workloads
                                (Polybench 4.1) and generate csv files, and
                                integrated the Likwid Marker API in each
                                workload to collect the counters.</p>
                                <p> I also performed some research on GPU
                                performance, and wrote another Python script to
                                collect performance values from the GPU and
                                output them into a csv, used by a machine
                                learning model. </p>
                                <h5 class="major">Citrus Hack 2016</h5>
                                <p> I participated in the Citrus Hack hackathon
                                at UC Riverside, During this, our team crafted a
                                prototype of an application that allows for
                                secure voting. We used tools such as Android
                                Studio and Firebase, as well as languages such
                                as XML and Java. I never had much experience
                                with these, but by the end of the 36 hour event,
                                I had learned the skills necessary to make my
                                own applications.</p>
                                <h5 class="major">Computer Science Club</h5> 
                                <p>In high school, I helped found the computer
                                science club, and was the first president. A
                                large project was called Gamestation, which
                                focused on both software and hardware. We
                                created individual game stations (similar to a
                                Nintendo Game Boy) that had the ability to be
                                programmed with games or other software. It
                                required learning how to solder, as every
                                component (resistors, capacitors, monitor,
                                speaker, etc) had to be soldered on to the empty
                                circuit board. After the hardware portion was
                                completed, we programmed a few games for it in
                                Python and uploaded them to our devices.</p>
